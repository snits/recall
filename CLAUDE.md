# Recall

Read-only MCP server providing Claude with search access to engineering-notebook's
session history database. Searches journal summaries and full conversation text
across sessions from multiple hosts.

## PROJECT SCALE CONTEXT

- **Users:** Single user (Jerry), single AI consumer (Claude)
- **Tool type:** MCP server (stdio transport)
- **Codebase size:** Small (~200 LOC expected)
- **Complexity:** Low — read-only SQLite queries, no state management
- **Process overhead:** Minimal — this is a straightforward utility
- **Default approach:** Pragmatic, ship it fast, iterate if needed

## Tech Stack

- Bun runtime
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- bun:sqlite (read-only)

## Conventions

- Match engineering-notebook's TypeScript style where applicable
- No unnecessary abstractions — this is a thin query layer over SQLite
- All database access is read-only

## Testing

- Integration tests against a test SQLite database with known fixture data
- No mocks — test against real SQLite

## kata issue tracker

This project uses [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) as its shared issue
ledger. Run `kata quickstart` at the start of each session for the full agent
contract. The short version:

- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --agent`.
- Prefer updating existing issues over duplicates (`kata comment`, `kata label add`, `kata edit`).
- Default to `--agent` for ordinary reads and mutations; use `--json` only when a script needs structured data.
- Close only verified work: `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
- If work is incomplete, label `needs-review` and comment what remains rather than closing.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.

## kata work.* conventions (agent orchestration)

When working a kata-tracked issue, keep its `work.*` metadata truthful
(see docs/operations/agent-orchestration.md for the full recipe):

- On claim/start: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention ok`; if the work has a
  dedicated branch, stamp it once with `kata meta set <ref> work.branch <branch>`.
- Signal live state: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention stuck|needs-human|ok`
  plus a one-line `work.attention_msg` saying why. Raise `stuck` when you cannot
  proceed, `needs-human` when you want review; clear back to `ok` when unblocked.
- Never stop with the signal stale: close the issue, or leave the attention
  pair reflecting the hand-off.
- Coordinators read `work.*` on issues they delegated; only the working agent
  writes them. `work.*` on closed issues is meaningless.
